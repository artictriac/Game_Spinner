# Game_Spinner
Simple PIC based LED Spinner / Pseudo Random Number Picker 1-10 for use with board games. 

My IDE is MPLABX, the compiler is XC8, the microcontroller is a PIC16F628A programmed using the PicKit3.

The case is available for download on Thingiverse (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1760975). 

Video of the spinner in action is on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yair9v3l6-U)
